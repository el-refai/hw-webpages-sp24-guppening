							<h1>Abstract</h1>
							<p>
                Quick synthesis of novel views in a 3D scene given a limited amount of
                views is a fast-growing research area in graphics and computer vision. A
                variety of approaches to learn the plenoptic function have been
                explored, including Neural Radiance Fields, Plenoxels, and recently, 3D
                Gaussian Splatting, a technique where a machine learning model fills a
                scene with millions of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimizes their
                shape, size, and color to approximate the scene as best as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Extensions to Gaussian splatting such as 4D Gaussian Splatting and
                Language-Embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting allow for quick rendering of
                novel views within a dynamic scene from obtained from videos (as opposed
                a static scene obtained from images) as well as identification/semantic
                encoding of objects in a scene, respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our project aims to combine the two to add semantic encoding across time
                within the changing scene learned by Gaussian Splatting, allowing the
                creation of heatmaps and fast object tracking within scenes.

			<h3>Rendering to the Viewer Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Model learns dynamic scene using 4DGS / 3DLEGS</li>
      <li>Initialization
        <ul>
          <li>Initialize a socket to establish communication with SIBR viewer through which the model and viewer communicate</li>
          <li>Two-way communication initiated between model client and viewer when both are running</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rendering Loop
        <ul>
          <li>SIBR viewer sends camera parameters to model through established socket connection</li>
          <li>CUDA kernel renders a frame based on the parameters received through the socket and sends it back to the viewer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Viewer Display
        <ul>
          <li>User changes parameters to affect visualization through interactive panels in the viewer (timestamp, language features, etc)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Interactive Viewer Visualizations</h3>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <h4>Bouncing Balls</h4>
        <video controls width="100%">
          <source src="videos/bouncingballs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>Toggling the timestamp in the GUI shows the balls bouncing, and the gaussian splats capture the nice shadows and squish of the balls.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <h4>Hell Warrior</h4>
        <video controls width="100%">
          <source src="videos/hellwarrior.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>Using the keycaps "I", "J", "K", and "L" is how you would rotate the camera around to see the warrior in the SIBR viewer.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <h4>Jumping Jacks</h4>
        <video controls width="100%">
          <source src="videos/jumpingjacks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>Using the keycaps "W", "A", "S", and "D" is how you would move the camera up, down, and to the sides in the viewer.</p>
      </div>
