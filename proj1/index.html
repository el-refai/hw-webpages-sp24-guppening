    <p>
      A high-level overview of what we implemented in this project would be a cloth simulator. In real-time. 
      That uses mass-spring dynamics and physical constraints that model what happens to cloth in real life. 
      And utilizes tricks seen in lecture to make the simulation more efficient. From numerical integration to 
      collision detection, we've implemented it all. 
      <br />
      But at the end of the day, we've made a cloth simulator. As a whole, this means that we have implemented 
      a cloth simulator that can be used to realistically simulate cloth in real-time.
      <br />
      After completing the project, we have learned many interesting things related to physics and simulating movement. 
      We especially learned a lot from our mistakes as that allowed us to correct our understanding 
      about the true physics behind cloth dropping. 
      We also have thoughts on how games are made and how they work under the hood 
      -- we're pretty proud of what we've accomplished!

  <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      We started out this project by building an evenly grid of masses connected by springs to model a piece of cloth.
      We made sure to check if the point is pinned and if the cloth's orientation is <code>HORIZONTAL</code>, 
      then we set the y coordinate for all point masses to 1.
      <br />
      We then construct the spring with <i>Structural</i>, <i>Shearing</i>, and <i>Bending</i> constraint types using <code>emplace_back</code>.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  </a>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Now that we've constructed the spring-mass model for cloths, we need to simulate how it will respond to external and
    internal forces. The first step is to compute the forces acting on each mass. We are given a set of external
    accelerations acting on the entire cloth, the sum of which we apply to each point based on their mass using 
    Newton's second law $F = ma$. Second, we apply the spring correction forces to each point mass according to Hooke's
    Law, where, given a spring with constant $k_s$, rest length $l$, and point masses $p_a, p_b$:
    $$
      ||F_s|| = k_s * (||p_a - p_b|| - l)
    $$
    Then the force is applied on each mass towards the other mass (For $p_a$, in the direction $p_b - p_a$ and in $p_b$,
    in the direction $p_a - p_b$). Third, now that all of the forces have been calculated, and thus the acceleration at
    each point, we use Verlet integration to estimate the trajectory of each point in discrete time. If $x_t$ is the
    position of a single point mass at time $t$, then given mass $m$, acceleration $a_t$, and discrete time step $dt$,
    we estimate
    $$
      x_{t + dt} = x_t + (1 - d)(x_t - x_{t - dt}) + a_t d_t^2
    $$
    Here $d$ represents a damping coefficient used to model the loss of energy in the cloth as it moves.
    There are limitations to this spring-mass model; for example, the springs have no limit to how much they can deform,
    which can result in unrealistically violent motion. Real life cloth fibers don't demonstrate this, and we will
    account for this by naively capping the change in each spring's length to $10\%$ of its original length.

    <p>
      Changing the spring constant <code>ks</code> to a very low value results in the fabric being very loose and not holding its initial shape. 
      Whether it was in the initial configuration or during the movement caused by the cloth dropping in the simulation, 
      the fabric was very stretch and loose.
      When we changed the spring constant <code>ks</code> to a very high value, the fabric was very tight 
      and while it still did not hold its initial shape perfectly, it was closer to doing so, 
      it was not as loose as when <code>ks</code> was very low: it was more stiff.

      This makes sense as the spring constant <code>ks</code> is the stiffness of the springs that connect the masses. 
      When <code>ks</code> is very low, the springs are very loose and the fabric is very stretchy. 
      When <code>ks</code> is very high, the springs are very tight and the fabric is very stiff 
      -- which means it will be very hard to stretch the fabric.

    </div>

    <p>
      The effect of density on cloth behavior is somewhat more complex. At first, it appears to be inverse to the effect
      of spring tension; as density decreases, the cloth descends more slowly from its starting position, and the top
      edge of the cloth deforms less under the cloth's own weight at rest, in a similar manner to increasing $k_s$. 
      However, the correlation with density on the level of deformation on the cloth's surface is non-linear; at low
      and high densities, the surface of the cloth is smooth; at medium densities, the surface shows more ripples. This 
      can be explained by the difference in how spring tension and density effect the dynamics of the point masses. The 
      former resists all changes in position, and thus with higher $k_s$ all forms of deformation are decreased. The
      latter directly corresponds to the mass of each point, which primarly affects deformation from the force of
      gravity. At low or high densities, either spring force or gravity are the dominant force, causing the surface to
      flatten out. At medium densities the forces are about equal which causes the point masses to be suspended and not
      flatten out.

    <p>
      Damping acts as a weight on the velocity term of the Verlet integration, so a cloth that is more damped will move 
      more slowly, but the total forces at rest are unchanged. This result is demonstrated above. In addition, the two 
      cloths that were less damped oscillated like a tire swing before coming to rest -- the undamped cloth never came
      to rest at all, instead demonstrating a perpetual pendulumn motion.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Our cloth simulator does not currently handle collisions with other objects. In this section, we added support for 
    collisions with spheres and planes. 
    We did this by modifying the <code>Sphere::collide</code> and <code>Plane::collide</code> methods 
    in <code>plane.cpp</code> and <code>sphere.cpp</code> respectively.
    Specifically we checked if the trajectory of the point mass has intersected with the sphere or plane, and if so, 
    we apply a correction to the last non-colliding position of the mass, such that it lies tangent to the surface of 
    the sphere or plane. In addition, we account for the friction of the point mass by scaling the correction down by 
    $1 - f$.

    <p>
      The higher the spring constant, the less the shape of the cloth conforms around the sphere after coming to rest
      around it. As the parts of the cloth touching the top of the sphere come to rest first, they exert corrective
      spring forces on the rest of the cloth, pulling them upwards. If these forces are weak, the rest of the cloth
      continues to descend and bring more points tangent to the sphere. If the forces are strong, they bring these parts
      of the cloth to rest before more "wrapping" is possible, causing sections of cloth to flare outward from the 
      sphere.

  </a>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This doesn't account for all possible collisions; most critically, it doesn't handle when the cloth collides with
    itself! You can see this when running <code>./clothsim -f ../scene/selfCollision.json</code> with unfortunate
    results.

  <p>
    The solution to this problem is an intuitive one; check for pairs of point masses that are too close to each other,
    and apply a position correction that simulates the repulsive force between the two masses. The final change in
    position of each point mass is the average of their correction vectors.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Checking every pair of points requires $O(n^2)$ time, which is not suitable for our large number of points. Instead,
    we partition the 3D space into a set of boxes, and hash each point to a table based on which box contains them.
    Since a point mass can only collide with the masses in the same box, this causes collision checking to speed up
    considerably.

    <p>
      Above we can see that higher densities and lower spring constants cause the cloth to fold in on itself more 
      erratically. This is because the cloth is more likely to collide with itself in small folds when it is more 
      dense, and the cloth is more likely to be pulled apart when the spring constants are lower.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is user-defined code that a graphics processor uses during its rendering pipeline. In this
      pipeline, vertex shaders operate before fragment shaders; they are responsible for the geometry of individual
      vertices in the model being rendered. For each vertex, the shader transforms the vertex position as necessary
      (converting to post-projection space or, in the case of displacement mapping, offsetting the position according
      to some vertex property), as well as generating information on that vertex necessary to per-vertex lighting, such
      as the vertex normal and texture coordinate <em>uv</em>. The fragment shader operates after the vertex shader has
      completed, using "fragments" of the rasterized model. Its job is to determine the color of this rastered fragment,
      using the vertex information produced by the vertex shader as well as the specified shading method (Blinn-Phong, 
      texture-mapped, etc). Each fragment shader typically corresponds to a unique shading method.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Blinn-Phong shading is a per-vertex shading model that takes the surface normal at the vertex $\mathbf{n}$, as
      as the ray from the vertex to the point light source $\mathbf{l}$, as well as the light intensity $\mathbf{I}$
      and distance to the light source $r = ||l||$, and computes the intensity of the light arriving at that vertex:
      $$
        \mathbf{L} = \underbrace{k_a\mathbf{I}_a}_{\text{Ambient component}} + \underbrace{\mathbf{k}_d (\mathbf{I} / r^2) \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l})}_{\text{Diffuse component}} + \underbrace{k_s (\mathbf{I} / r^2) \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{h})^p}_{\text{Specular component}}
      $$
      Let us examine the three terms individually. The ambient component approximates ambient light, or the light that
      that would hypothetically arrive after more than one bounce (since our scene comprises only the sphere and cloth,
      this is uncommon and can't really be modeled). We use the crude but effective method of setting ambient lighting
      to a constant:
      $$
        k_a = 0.1, \mathbf{I}_a = \mathbb{1}
      $$ 
      The diffuse component represents the diffuse (uniform over a hemisphere) reflection of light by the sphere and
      cloth. It is affected by the distance to the light as well as the angle of the surface relative to the direction
      of light, as determined by Lambert's cosine law. Since this comprises a vast majority of the total reflectance of
      the scene in the Blinn-Phong model, we weight this term by 100% of the light emitted (in other words, $\mathbf{k}_d$ equals the RGB intensity of the light source).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, there is specular lighting. Like ambient lighting, this represents a small minority of the total lighting

      in the render. It represents the light that is reflected off the scene in a mirror-like fashion. For us to see this specular reflection at a vertex, the outgoing vector $v$ from that vertex to the camera must be the mirror
      reflection of the incident vector $l$ from the light source to that vertex. In mathematical terms, the bisecting
      vector
      $$
      h = \frac{v + l}{||v + l||}
      $$
      must be as close to the normal as possible. Thus the intensity of the specular component is dependent on $n \cdot 
      h$. Since we want the reflectance to taper off quickly for less than perfect specular reflectance ($n \cdot h < 
      1$), we will raise this term to a large power, in our case $p = 100$. We set $k_s = 0.5$.

    <p>
      While both bump mapping and displacement mapping display the texture on the cloth's surface, in the case of the
      former, the geometry of the cloth is unmodified, giving the texture a "flat" look. The latter, by comparison,
      modifies the vertices of the cloth according to the texture height, introducing a further degree of realism; this
      can be seen in the rough profile of the render.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above images were rendered with a horizontal and vertical vertex resolution of 128. When we decrease this
      resolution to 16 x 16, notice the increase in smoothness of displacement mapping due to there being fewer
      vertices to transform:

      displacement mapping, and mirror shading (Bump mapping and diffuse shading are subsets of some of these
      techniques, and texture mapping was incompatible with mirror reflection). Notice the visble texture and roughness
      of profile compared to the original mirror render, as well as the brighter colors from Blinn-Phong shading:

    <h3> Wind </h3>
    <p>
      In addition, we implemented wind as a vector field by computing additional forces on each point mass as a function
      of their position. The final formula we used was
      $$
        \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = (-2, 0, -2) * e^{-y(z - 1)}
      $$
      In other words, the wind blows the cloth in the $-x$ and $-z$ directions, acting more strongly on the lower parts
      of the cloth and tapering off in the $+z$ direction. Observe the result on <code>pinned2.json</code>:
