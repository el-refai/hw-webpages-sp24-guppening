			In this project we go an introduction to Bezier curves and triangle meshes. We first implemented Bezier curves and Bezier surfaces with de Casteljau's algorithm 
      then we worked on improving shading using area-weighted vertex normals. We then moved on to how do we go about flipping and splitting edges on triangle meshes. With the final conclusion of this homework being the implementation of loop subdivision for upsampling our meshes to make them smoother.
      We then implemented all of the extra credit in this homework from support boundary edge splits to supporting loop subdivision on meshes with boundary edges and $\sqrt{3}$-subdivision.
      We found these extra credit tasks to be the most interesting and the results of them to be really satisfying when visualized on the meshes!

    <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				Given $n$ control points ($p_0, p_1, ..., p_n$) and a parameter $t$ de Casteljau's algorithm evaluates Bezier curves by at each step: linearly interpolating between control point $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ and creates a new control point that is $t$ away from $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$. This results in $n-1$ new control points. The process is then repeated on these new control points until there is only one control point left. This control point will lie on the Bezier curve. This whole process is repeated for varying values of $t$ where $t \in [0,1]$ to gives us many points which lie on the Bezier curve at different positions, essentially recreating the curve.

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
		de Casteljau's algorithm directly relates to Bezier surfaces as you can think of Bezier surfaces as a 3D extension of the 2D Bezier curve where now it is collection of control points distributed in 3D space. We can evaluate this surface with de Casteljau's algorithm by first evaluating the control points row-wise along the x-axis and varying our parameter $u \in [0,1]$ to evaluate each Bezier curve oriented in the x-direction. We then repeat this process in the y-direction where for every control point for a given $u$ we then apply de Casteljau's algorithm on this with the parameter $v \in [0,1]$ to give us the control point along that perpendicular Bezier curve. We implemented this by varying $u, v$ to give us the points in 3D space that lie on the Bezier surface.

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
			To implement vertex normals, we started by doing traversals about the central vertex. We did this by taking the code for traversing all the vertices adjacent to a vertex and for each set of vertices that formed a triangular face with the central vertex, we took the cross product of two of the vertices in order to get the normal vector of the face. Then, using some knowledge from algebra classes, took half the norm of the normal vector to get the area of the triangle. We then normalized the normal vector, and stored that vector and the area in a list. After doing this for all the faces, we then took each vector, multiplied by the area of the face over the total area of all the faces, and added them all together to get the normal vector of the central vertex. As can be seen below, this allows for smooth Phong shading, which gives our teapot a much more realistic lighting look.

		</a>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
		  <ul>
			To implement edge flips in our mesh, we started by making drawings like the ones suggested in the spec, such that we have a ground truth to debug against. When the function is called, we first check that the edge is not on a boundary and then started by getting pointers (or rather iters) to each halfedge, edge, face, and vertex that surrounded the edge being flipped. From there, all we had to do was look to our drawings and fill the new corresponding pointers for halfedges, faces, edges, and vertices, while ensuring that the original edge has been flipped to the correct orientation. Outside of our use of the drawing method, we didn't find that we needed any special methods to complete this task.

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
		  <ul>
			Like the edge flips, we again started by making drawings like the ones suggested in the spec, this time noting down the new halfedges, edges, faces, and vertices that would need to be made. We then went about implementing the function similarly, by first getting pointers to the appropriate elements and then creating the new elements that would be needed to split the edge. From there we calculated the proper edge midpoint to get the position of the new vertex and finally set all the applicable pointers for halfedges, edges, faces, and vertices. As a debugging trick, we were sure to use the check_for functions which allowed us to check and make sure that each element was pointing to and pointed to by the correct elements.

		  <p>
			Unlike the previous task, we (unfortunately) had an eventful debugging journey. When we first tried to run the function, we saw that nothing rendered at all, which suggested to us that there was some inconsistency with our updated pointers. We checked all the updates against our drawings again and again, but were still unable to notice any issues. We at last resorted to using the check_for function, and finally noticed that one of our half edges had two twins, and we knew we had found our culprit. For a single half edge, we had accidentally switched around the next and twin half edges, resulting in our mesh being unable to render. After this though, everything went smoothly. 
		  </p>

		<blockquote><b>
			If you have implemented support for boundary edges, show screenshots of your implementation properly handling split operations on boundary edges.
		</b></blockquote>

		  <p>
		   To support boundary edges, we again made drawings, this time with just a single triangle on a boundary. The tricky part for this extra credit was figuring out the correct method for splitting the halfedge on the boundary, and we settled on making the new halfedge the next edge of the original boundary edge, making sure to set its next and face pointers to be the same as those of the original existing edge. From there everything worked as expected, and we were able to split boundary edges without any need for debugging.

		<h2 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
			To perform loop upsampling, we followed the rough outline provided by the spec. We started by iterating through all the vertices in the mesh and for each one set its isNew value to false and then computed the new position for the vertex via the equations provided in lecture. Next we did something similar for all the edges in the mesh, setting their isNew value to false and calculating the position of the new vertex that will be in the middle of the edge. Next we iterated through all the edges again, this time splitting each edge which had isNew = False and setting the newPosition value of the outputted vertex to be the newposition value of the edge that it was split from. We also modified our splitting function and edge class in two ways. First, we set all the new edges made from the splitting to have the isNew attribute be true. Second, we added an isValid attribute, which basically indicated whether the edge was valid to be flipped afterwards. We only made this true in the splitting function for edges that spanned across the faces (instead of the new edge that went along the old edge being split). In the penultimate loop, we iterate through every single edge, and for each that is an isValid attribute set to true and is connected to one new vertex and one old vertex, we flip the edge. Lastly, we iterate through all the vertices, and set their position to their newPosition value, which was computed earlier. The isValid attribute proved to be critical to ensuring that we didn't flip unnecessary edges, as before we did this we had bugs with our meshes having incorrectly flipped edges.

		<blockquote><b>
			Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
		</b></blockquote>

		<p>
			Looking at the screenshots above, we can see that sharp corners tend to add a bump to the mesh that does not get well smoothed out, even after multiple subdivisions. By pre-splitting some edges, this essentially provides more polygons around these sharp areas, allowing for a greater degree of smoothing when the Loop subdivision is performed. Below, the edges around the upper right corner of the cube have been pre-split. Upon subdivision, you can see that compared to the lower left corner, the cube is a lot more smooth and rounded. Thus we can see that when we are dealing with sharp differences in the behavior of a mesh, by increasing the number of triangles in the area subdivision will be more effective and smoothing sharp regions.

		</b></blockquote>

		<p>
			In the original cube, the sides of the cubes are asymmetric in terms of the triangle positioning. Two corners are connected by edges and two are not. This leads to the asymmetry and almost pear-shaped (no pun intended) look of the cube after subdivision. By splitting this central edge on each side, now there is an edge going to each corner on each side of the cube, making the cube fully symmetric. Once we've subdivided with this change, the cube remains symmetric afterwards and retains a more uniform smoothed shape.

		<h3>Supporting Boundary Edge Subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				To support boundary edge subdivision, we needed to find new equations for calculating the new positions of boundary vertices and the positions of vertices in split boundary edges. Since we want to keep boundaries very close to what they were before, according to the original Loop subdivision algorithm we do a weighted average of only the other vertices along the edge. For existing vertices, this was $\frac 34$ of the original vertex's position along with $\frac 14$ of the two vertices on either side of it. For vertices that came from boundary edge splits, we simply took the average of the two vertices that were on either side of the original edge. Since we had already implemented boundary edge splits, this was all we had to do, and the rest was compatible with our original Loop subdivision implementation.
			</ul>

		<h3>Adding $\sqrt 3$ Subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
			In addition to Loop subdivision, we also implemented $\sqrt 3$ subdivision. Instead of splitting edges, this method splits faces into three separate faces, adding an edge between a central vertex that is the average of the original vertex positions and each of the original vertices surrounding the face. Then the original edges get flipped to maintain a regular structure. Finally, vertex positions are updated. To do this, we just had to implement a face split function, and then created a subdivision function very similar to that of Loop subdivision, replacing the vertex recomputation function with the one from the original root 3 subdivision paper and replacing edge splits with face splits. From the images below, one can see that this method is a lot better at smoothing out sharp edges, and by the time level 4 subdivision is reached, the mesh is almost spherical, save for a few extraordinary vertices.
