    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p> We implemented a real-time simulation of cloth using masses and springs which was done by imposing physical constraints on the masses and springs then using numerical integration to simulate the way cloth moves over time.
      We then handled collisions between the cloth and other objects and the cloth with itself, ensuring that the cloth acts realistically. Finally, we added in various forms of shading from diffuse and blinn-phong to texture, displacement, and bump mapping with environment-mapped reflections as well.
      But that isn't all! We also worked on a ton of extra credit from adding wind, axis-aligned bounding boxes for collisions, to collisions on regular and general polyhedrons.</p>

    </b></blockquote>
    <p>
      Since <code>ks</code> refers to the spring constant which is how strong the internal forces that hold the cloth together are, we find that increasing the spring constant results in a much stiffer cloth, making it more resistant to deforming. This can be seen when we increase the spring constant to $500,000$ and the resulting cloth sags far less in the middle compared to the cloths with a lower spring constant.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Density in this case is the density of each point mass in the mass spring system that 
      makes up our cloth this means that altering changes the gravitational force exerted on 
      the cloth since the weight of the cloth changes with the density. When we increase the 
      density we find that visually it seems to have the opposite effect compared to 
      increasing the spring constant when viewing the cloth at rest. An increased 
      density seems to sag more when at rest compared to the default density. This is due to the 
      increased density making the force of gravity far more pronounced 
      giving us a cloth that deforms more readily. When we decrease the density when compared 
      to the default we find that the cloth is more upright however this is due moreso to the 
      fact that the reduced force of gravity means that the springs are more capable of 
      resisting it, giving us a cloth that maintains its original shape better.

      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Damping is what we use to simulate the loss of energy in the system due to friction, heat loss, etc... The first photo shows how with no damping the cloth is capable of swinging all the way forward and backward. When the damping is higher this backward and forward motion is far less pronounced and the rate at which the cloth falls slows down proportionally. Another interesting thing we noticed is that when you compare all four images with different damping levels we find that lower levels of damping seem to crease more when falling while with higher levels of damping the creases are less pronounced and instead the cloth is smoother. A very high damping value has the cloth fall noticeably slower versus a very low damping value.

      We find that increasing the spring constant compared to the default has the cloth noticeably more upright. The creases are also larger but fewerr in number.

    <p>
      We find that as we increase the density the cloth spreads out less and has more smaller folds onto itself. Meanwile decreasing the density has the opposite effect as the lighter cloth is able to spread out more and as a result the folds are less frequent but are larger.
      When we increase the spring constant we also find that the stretchier cloth is able to spread out more and that there are fewer folds that are larger. When we decrease the spring constant the stiffer cloth has more folds but these folders are smaller as the cloth does not spread out as much during its descent.

    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a program that compiles and links vertex and fragment shaders and runs the vertex shader first then passes the result from the vertex shader to the fragment shader. These shader programs can be ran in parallel on a GPU where sections of the graphics pipeline are executed, ex: vertex processing and fragment processing. The vertex shaders apply transforms to the a given vertex which modifies its position and normal vector it also generates the vertex's texture coordinates <code>uv</code>. The fragment shader uses the fragments generated by the rasterization process and the geometric properties of each vertex given by the vertex shader and the shading method to compute the correct color for each fragment.

    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model works by computing the color per-vertex. It works by summing together the ambient light, diffuse shading, and reflected light at a given pixel and setting that as the light value for that pixel.  
      It computes these three components using the surface normal at the vertex $n$ and treats it as a ray from the vertex to our light source $l$, the distance from the vertex to the light source is $r$ and $I_a$ is the ambient intensity of light while $I$ is the light intensity coming from the light source.
      The ambient light $L_a = k_a I_a$ while the diffuse component $L_d = k_d (I/r^2) \max(0, n \cdot l)$ and the specularity component is $L_s = k_s(I/r^2)\max(0, n \cdot h)^p$ with the final light for the vertex being $L = L_a + L_d + L_s$.

    <p>
      With bump mapping we find that when we used a finer sphere that the results are a smoother and less jagged spehere with the texture being applied more smoothly meanwhile the coarser sphere has noticeable corners. As for displacement mapping we notice a similar thing where the coarser mesh results in a very jagged surface while the smoother mesh is much more rounded. The difference between bump mapping and displacement mapping though is that bump mapping doesn't change the geometry of the object which does make it smoother but also loses some realism while displacement mapping does actually modify the positions of the vertices according to texture height.

    <h3 align="middle">Adding Wind</h3>

    <p>
      To add wind, we first had to figure out a way to quantify the impact of a wind force on the cloth. 
      After doing some research, we found that for the movie Frozen, Disney created new methods for simulating the effects of wind on cloth and <a href="https://media.disneyanimation.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/115/asset/cloth_hair_wind.pdf">published them.</a>  
      To summarize, we represent wind as a uniform vector field where every point in our scene is effected by a wind with a given velocity and direction. From this we can calculate the force vector on an area of the cloth as $F = \frac 12 \rho A ((C_D - C_L)(\textbf{v} \cdot \textbf{n})\textbf{v} + C_L |v|^2\textbf{n})$.
      In this $\rho$ is the density of air, $A$ is the area of the fragment we are calculating the force for, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $C_L$ is the lift coefficient, $\textbf{v}$ is the velocity vector of the wind, and $\textbf{n}$ is the normal vector of the cloth for the given area.
      To implement this for the project, we went through the cloth and calculated the force on each square section. Then we distributed the force on the square to each of the points that make the square. In addition, we added components to the GUI that let the user configure the wind speed, direction, and lift and drag coefficients live. 
      This resulted in a number of really cool effects, which are detailed in the gifs below (ignore the blue artifacting, this is a product of the gif production process). We can see that increasing the drag coefficient produces more flapping, while increasing the lift coefficient essentially increases how much the cloth is pushed up by the wind. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">AABB Based BVH Self-Collisions</h3>
    <p>
      We also implemented axis-aligned bounding box based self collisions for the cloth, allowing for errorless self collision, as opposed to spatial hashing which is prone to errors particularly if a point is close to a spatial boundary. 
      We implemented these bounding boxes very similarly to how they were done in homework 3, in which we split along the largest axis each time and recursively split until there is less than a certain number of masses left. Then intersection querying is done exactly as was done with raytracing and we used the same repulsion code as previously.
      While this guarantees intersection with all possible masses and is fairly quick in most cases ($O(n\log{n}$) in the best case), in the case where the cloth is very bunched up in the same place it can be very slow (and result in $O(n^2)$ time for all the collisions) however, spatial hashing can also suffer from this issue. 
      Below are some images of this working as intended!

    <h3 align="middle">Axis-Aligned Box Collisions</h3>
    <p>To start, we wanted to do collisions with objects we were familiar with, so given our experience in Project 3, we decided to work with axis-aligned boxes. To render them, we just had to define a list of vertices and then calculate the normals of the faces and vertices.
    The vertex normals were used to shade the objects, mainly because the color gradients looked cool (though we couldve done face normal shading as well). 
    To do the collisions, we first checked if the new point location was inside the box, and then used the previous location and current location to make a ray from the points. 
    From there we used the same methodology as intersecting bounding boxes in Project 3 to find the closest intersection, and then used the normal of the face to calculate the appropriate adjustment.
    Below are two examples of the cloth colliding with axis-aligned boxes.

    <h3 align="middle">Regular Polyhedron Collisions</h3>
    <p>
      We wanted to expand our collisions to more complex polyhedra, so the next logical choice was regular polyhedra. 
      To set up the objects, we needed to change our object representation to include the faces, which we did by listing the vertices around each face in counterclockwise order. 
      We then calculated the normals for each face by taking the cross product of the vectors between the vertices, and used the face normals to calculate the vertex normals as the average of the incident face normals.
      With this, we could render the polyhedra, but now we needed to set up the collisions. After doing some research, we reasoned that a parametric line clipping algorithm would work perfectly for this use case, and found a great explanation at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111004134432/http://softsurfer.com/Archive/algorithm_0111/algorithm_0111.htm">this website.</a>
      Interestingly, the algorithm was very similar to the one we used for axis-aligned boxes. 
      Given the vector from the previous point location to the current point location, $\textbf{d}$, we represented the line going through the previous point as $P(t)=p _0 + t\textbf{d}$, where $\textbf{p}_0$ is the previous point location. We then computed $t$ for each face $i$ by using the equation $t_i = \frac{(V_i-P_0)\cdot \textbf{n}_i}{\textbf{d}\cdot \textbf{n}_i}$ were $V_i$ is a vertex on the face and $\textbf{n}_i$ is the normal of the face.
      We can use the sign of $\textbf{d}\cdot \textbf{n}_i$ to determine if at this intersection point the parameterized line is entering or leaving the polyhedron. Then, much like with the axis-aligned boxes, we calculate the closest intersection point by taking the max of the entering $t$ values. We then move the cloth to the appropriate location on the surface of the object the same way that it was done with the plane and axis-aligned boxes. This resulted in the images below, which show our cloth intersecting both a tetrahedron and an icosahedron.

    <h3 align="middle">General Polyhedron Collisions</h3>
    <p>
      With the regular polyhedra figured out, we reasoned that we could generalize our intersection algorithm and polyhedra object representation to any convex polyhedra. 
      The hardest part here was actually defining the polyhedra, as we needed to be sure to correctly order the vertices around each face such that the face normals were calculated correctly. 
      Without this, the intersection algorithm would not work (and this was the main source of bugs). Below we show the algorithm working with a few different polyhedra, both symmetric and asymmetric.
